## Introduction
"Firefly III" is a (self-hosted) manager for your personal finances. It can help you keep track of your expenses and income, so you can spend less and save more. Firefly III supports the use of budgets, categories and tags. It can import data from external sources and it has many neat financial reports available. Here are some screenshots:

### Purpose
Personal financial management is pretty difficult, and everybody has their own approach to it. Some people make budgets, other people limit their cashflow by throwing away their credit cards,  others try to increase their current cashflow. There are tons of ways to save and earn money. Firefly III works on the principle that if you know where you're money is going, you can stop it from going there.

By keeping track of your expenses and your income you can budget accordingly and save money. Stop living from paycheck to paycheck but give yourself the financial wiggle room you need.

You can read more about this in the [official documentation](http://firefly-iii.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

### Features
Most importantly...

* Firefly III runs on your own server, so you are fully in control of your data. It will not contact other sites or servers.

## The goal
Firefly III should give you **insight** into and **control** over your finances. Money should be useful, not scary. You should be able to *see* where it is going, to *feel* your expenses and to... wow, I'm going overboard with this aren't I?

But you get the idea: this is your money. These are your expenses. Stop them from controlling you. I built this tool because I started to dislike money. Having it, not having, paying bills with it, etc. But no more. I want to feel "safe", whatever my balance is. And I hoop this tool can help. I know it helps me.
